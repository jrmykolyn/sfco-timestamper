# Short Future Co. - Timestamper

## About
Do you lose sleep over the thought of going a day without contributing to a repo? Does the thought of seeing a blank square on your GitHub contribution grid fill you with existential dread? If so, `Timestamper` is for you!

With a single command, `Timestamper` adds and commits a meaningless update to a predetermined repository. Is midnight approaching and you haven't made any contributions today? Not a problem, simply invoke the `timestamper` command and rest easy knowing that your contribution grid will remain a sea of competent green (just hope that no one looks too closely at *what* in particular you're contributing).

## Installation
```
npm install --g sfco-timestamper
```

## Setup
`timestamper` is installed globally, and does not require any additional setup.

## Usage
From the command line, invoke the `timestamper` command.

## Documentation
Currently, `sfco-timestamper` *does not* include any external documentation.

For an overview of the project's evolution, please consult the `CHANGELOG`.
